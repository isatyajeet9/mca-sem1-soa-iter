  <p>
    <b><i>Biriyani</i></b>At Bhubaneswar Biryani House, we believe a great meal is more than just
    food; it’s a journey through time and tradition. Our story begins with a
    passion for recreating the authentic, slow-cooked biryani that has
    enchanted palates for centuries. We don't rush the process; we honor it.
    Each batch is prepared with the utmost care, following time-honored
    recipes that have been perfected over generations. We source the finest,
    long-grain basmati rice, known for its fragrance and delicate texture.
    This is layered with our meticulously marinated meat—succulent chicken or
    tender mutton—and a secret blend of hand-ground spices that burst with
    aromatic flavor. The secret to our legendary taste lies in the traditional
    "dum" cooking method, where the biryani is sealed in a pot and slow-cooked
    over a gentle flame. This process allows the flavors to meld together
    perfectly, infusing every grain of rice and every piece of meat with a
    depth of flavor that is truly unparalleled. When you break the seal on one
    of our biryanis, you're not just opening a dish; you're uncovering a rich,
    historical culinary masterpiece. Experience the heritage, the aroma, and
    the unforgettable taste that has been celebrated by royalty and
    connoisseurs alike.

          <li><b>Step 1</b> To prepare this Mughlai recipe, take a large bowl, mix chicken with yoghurt (curd), fried
            onion, red chilli powder, salt, coriander leaves, mint leaves, ginger and garlic paste. Mix all the
            ingredients well and let the chicken marinate for about 2 hours. When the chicken is marinated, add garam
            masala in it.</li>
          <li><b>Step 2</b> Once the chicken is marinated, melt ghee in a handi over medium flame. When ghee is melted,
            add marinated chicken in it and fry for 2-3 minutes. Then, add water to it and cook the chicken on a
            low-medium flame. Put the lid on the vessel once the chicken is cooked.</li>
          <li><b>Step 3</b> Now, add 70 per cent cooked basmati rice in it. Above the rice layer, add brown or fried
            onion, ghee and saffron water (saffron soaked in 2 tbsp water) and a little water.</li>
          <li><b>Step 4</b> Knead a quick dough with wheat flour and seal the handi with this dough, and then cover with
            a lid. Let the biryani stay like this for 20 minutes. This will give the perfect 'dum' to the biryani. Serve
            it hot with raita.</li>
