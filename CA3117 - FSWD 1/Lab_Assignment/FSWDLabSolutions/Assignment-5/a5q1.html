Q1. Write the difference between Java & JavaScript.

Java                                                                                                                                                                                    

Java is an object-oriented programming language used for building standalone applications, web apps, Android apps, etc.  
Java is compiled (into bytecode using JVM).                                                                                                                          
Java runs on JVM (Java Virtual Machine).                                                                                                               
Strongly typed (you must define data types).                                                                                                                        
Used for backend development, enterprise applications, Android, desktop applications.                                              
Syntax is similar to C/C++ and is more complex.                                                                                                                                 

JavaScript

JavaScript is a scripting language used mainly for making web pages interactive and dynamic.
JavaScript is interpreted by web browsers.
JavaScript runs directly on the browser or on Node.js.
Loosely typed (no need to specify data types). 
Used for frontend development, web animations, validations, backend (Node.js), etc.   
Syntax is simpler and more flexible.
